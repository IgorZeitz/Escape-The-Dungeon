## Overview
Escape The Dungeon is a 2D pixel-art educational game where the player must navigate through a maze and find the exit. While wandering through the labyrinth, the player field of vision is limitted, encouraging spatial reasoning and problem-solving.
## Gameplay
The protagonist can be controlled using the arrows keys or wasd, allowing movement in four directions - up, left, down and right. Each level is a static design to encourage the player to observe, plan, and memorize paths rather than relying on random generation.
